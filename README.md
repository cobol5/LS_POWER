## User interface stuff for Qbasic andQuickBasic

When I was in high school during the mid-90s, I liked to toy about in Qbasic and later QuickBasic. During that time, I wrote a handful of user interface functions. I really don't know if they're of use to anyone or not, but maybe someone will get a kick out of them.
